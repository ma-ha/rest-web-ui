##About the API
The eBay API is not really RESTful, it's more ARRAYful. 
The sample shows some tricks to handle complex array structures and embedded result sets somewhere deep in the result tree.

##How to get it working
This is not working out of the box, since eBay don't allow CORS requests and so you need a [proxy.php](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=php+proxy') reverse proxy.

You also need to [register at eBay](https://developer.ebay.com) to get a SECURITY-APPNAME key.

##Working example

You are invited to [register for free at my 'portal as a service'](http://mh-svr.de/portal), to play around with the eBay API by yourself.
