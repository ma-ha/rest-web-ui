[MediaWiki API example using Wikipedia](http://mh-svr.de/portal/show.php?layout=MoGiuwzxzh) 

### Details about this example:
* The [page specification file](http://mh-svr.de/portal/svc/layout.php?page=MoGiuwzxzh) for this portal is really short and simple.
* Wikipedia is based on MediaWiki software, which is PHP based. That's not bad, but the API is not RESTful. You can find all the details in the [MediaWiki API documentation wiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page).
* This example shows also some tricky features about internationalization (i18n)
